# Spring AI with Ollama for RAG (Retrieve and Generate) using Custom Database

Welcome to the Spring AI with Ollama for RAG project! This proof of concept (POC) demonstrates the integration of Spring AI with Ollama to build a robust Retrieve and Generate (RAG) system using your own database data. The goal of this project is to showcase how to leverage state-of-the-art AI capabilities within a familiar Spring framework to enhance data retrieval and generation tasks.

## Key Features

- **Spring AI Integration**: Utilize Spring AI to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your Spring applications.
- **Ollama for RAG**: Leverage Ollamaâ€™s powerful retrieval and generation techniques to create a highly efficient RAG system.
- **Custom Database Integration**: Connect to your own database to perform AI-driven data retrieval and generation.
- **End-to-End Example**: An end-to-end demonstration from setting up the environment to deploying a working RAG system.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to handle large datasets and complex queries.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to incorporate additional AI models or database systems.
